The world outside looked a bit grey, but I could hear birds chirping and cars honking as they raced to beat the downpour. It must have been rainy all over the world because you can't escape its impact on your day too. Nevertheless, you still managed to put a smile on my face with your warmth and helpfulness. Thank you for being there for me today!"
